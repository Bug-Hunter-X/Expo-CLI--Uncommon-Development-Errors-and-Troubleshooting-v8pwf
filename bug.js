This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or library that's not properly configured or isn't compatible with your current Expo setup.  For example, if you are using a native module that requires additional setup or linking, this could lead to the error. Another common cause is issues with your project's `package.json` file, such as missing dependencies or incorrect versions.  Finally, a corrupted Expo Go app or a problem with your development environment can also trigger this error.
